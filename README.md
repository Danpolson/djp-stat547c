# An Introduction to Probabalistic Programming with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) - Daniel Polson

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a class of algorithms for sampling from a probability distribution. The idea behind MCMC is to construct a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, and then to sample from the chain after it has reached equilibrium. This allows us to draw samples from a distribution without having to directly compute the distribution. The methods focussed on in this paper include the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, and the Gibbs Sampler. These are long-used variations of MCMC, and continue to be in use to this day. The paper below requires some prior knowledge of measure theory and probability theory to prove the usefulness of these methods, and follows up with some basic applications.
